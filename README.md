It is a simple calculator file bash script used in Linux to perform the arithmentic calculations. Tried to perform the basic usage of functions ,case and argument acceptance through function while execution.
The script gets the input of the operands from the user.
It also gets the choice of operator to be used from the user to go ahead and perform the function.
